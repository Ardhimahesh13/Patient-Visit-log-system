# Patient Visit Log System

A simple yet effective desktop database application built with Microsoft Access and VBA to manage and track patient visit records. This project was developed as a beginner-friendly portfolio piece to demonstrate core database management and automation skills.

## üìã Project Overview

This application provides a user-friendly interface for a small clinic or a solo practitioner to log patient information and their visit details. The system simplifies data entry and allows for quick generation of a summary report, organized by patient, for easy tracking and analysis.

**1. Main Data Entry Form** - Clean and intuitive form for adding or viewing patient records.


**2. Patient Visit Summary Report** - A professional report grouping all visits by patient name.


## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Intuitive Data Entry:** A user-friendly form (`frmPatientEntry`) for seamless data input.
* **VBA-Powered Automation:** Form controls are automated with VBA for key functions:
    * **Add New Patient:** Clears the form for a new record.
    * **Save Record:** Commits the current record to the database.
    * **Close Form:** Safely closes the data entry form.
* **Structured Data Storage:** Utilizes a well-defined Access table (`tblPatientVisits`) to ensure data integrity.
* **Dynamic Summary Reporting:** Generates a clean, grouped, and sorted report (`rptPatientVisitSummary`) of all patient visits for easy review.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

* **Database:** Microsoft Access
* **Automation/Logic:** VBA (Visual Basic for Applications)
